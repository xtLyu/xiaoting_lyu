Hi! I am a 3th-year Ph.D. student in School of Computer Science and Technology at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://scit.bjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8493/). I am also advised by [Dr. Yufei Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdCvBg0AAAAJ&hl=en) (INRIA). Previously, I received my Bachelor degree from  Computer Science and Technology at [Wuhan University of Technology](https://www.whut.edu.cn/) in June 2019. 

## Research Interests

My research focuses on enhancing the robustness, privacy and generalization of ML, and the intersection of these topics, especially in language models, generative models, graph learning, and federated learning.
